        Life is a waterfall
        We're one in the river
        And one again after the fall

        Swimming through the void, we hear the word
        We lose ourselves, but we find it all

        'Cause we are the ones that want to play
        Always want to go, but you never want to stay

        And we are the ones that want to choose
        Always want to play but you never want to lose

        Aerials in the sky
        When you lose small mind, you free your life

        Life is a waterfall
        We drink from the river
        Then we turn around and put up our walls

        Swimming through the void, we hear the word
        We lose ourselves, but we find it all

        'Cause we are the ones that want to play
        Always want to go, but you never want to stay

        And we are the ones that want to choose
        Always want to play but you never want to lose
        Oh

        Aerials in the sky
        When you lose small mind, you free your life
        Aerials, so up high
        When you free your eyes, eternal prize
        Aerials in the sky
        When you lose small mind, you free your life
        Aerials, so up high
        When you free your eyes, eternal prize

        Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
        Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
        Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
        Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
